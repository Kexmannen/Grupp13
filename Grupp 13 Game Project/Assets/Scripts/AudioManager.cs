    //An Audioclip, a Volume and pitch setting and the possibility to loop
    //as well as adding volume and pitch randomness or spatial blend

    //THEN when we want to play a sound, we simply call a PLAY-method in the AudioController where we input the name of the sound we
    //want to play, then the AudioController is going to find the source with that name, and then play the sound.
